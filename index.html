                <p class="text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                    knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods
                    include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently
                    takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.
                Elsewhere during the Middle Ages, Islamic science and mathematics flourished under the Islamic caliphate
                which was established across the Middle East, extending from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the
                Indus in the east and to the Almoravid Dynasty and Mali Empire in the south.<a

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit
                purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with
                classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most
                school systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that
                system. Such choices include curriculum, organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces
                (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational
                activities, and more.

                The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was created by UNESCO as a statistical
                base to compare education systems. In 1997, it defined 7 levels of education and 25 fields, though
                the fields were later separated out to form a different project. The current version ISCED 2011 has 9
                rather than 7 levels, created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three levels.<a

            <p class="sectionTag test-big">Transforming of Education in India</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The education sector or education system is a group of institutions
                (ministries of education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools,
                universities, etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in
                educational settings. It involves a wide range of people (curriculum developers, inspectors, school
                principals, teachers, school nurses, students, etc.). These institutions can vary according to different
                contexts.

                Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements
                such as education policies and guidelines – to which school policies can refer – curricula and learning
                materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. The school environment – both
                physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) – is also guided by school policies that
                should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school. The Organisation for Economic
                Co-operation and Development has found that schools tend to perform best when principals have full
                authority and responsibility for ensuring that students are proficient in core subjects upon graduation.
